# Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model
The goal of this project, as a part of Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, is to deploy a sentiment analysis model in SageMaker.

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

You can find the original code in the original [Udacity SageMaker Deployment repository](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment).
